    "\n",
    "# Data Integrity: When you write data to a file, it may not be immediately flushed (written) to\n",
    "#     the disk. It might be stored in memory or a buffer until a certain condition is met, like a \n",
    "    \n",
    "#     buffer becoming full or the file being closed. If you don't close the file and the program \n",
    "#     terminates unexpectedly (e.g., due to a crash or error), data that you intended to write may be\n",
    "#     lost or corrupted.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Concurrency: In some cases, multiple processes or threads might access the same file. Closing the \n",
    "#     file ensures that other processes or threads can access and modify the file without conflicts. \n",
    "#     It also prevents potential issues with file locks and data consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Portability: Properly closing files makes your code more portable across different operating systems \n",
    "#     and programming environments. While many systems automatically close open files when a program exits, relying on this behavior is not a good practice. Explicitly closing files makes your code more reliable and less dependent on the specifics of the execution environment.\n",
